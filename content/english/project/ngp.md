- Headed by Ven. Dhammānanda
- Reason for translation: This book is a representative work of Pa Auk Sayadaw's systematic introduction to samādhi and vipassanā meditation, but there is no Chinese version. Previously, someone translated it into English, so we initiated a plan to translate it into Chinese.
- Reference: "Nibbāna gāminī paṭipadā" in Burmese and English
- Methodology: First, translate it from English to Chinese, and then use Burmese to correct it. When encountering translation and conceptual problems, U Kundadhana Sayadaw will act as a consultant to answer questions about translation issues.
- Participants: U Kundadhana Sayadaw (consultant), more than ten members in the English team, and two members in the Burmese team.
- Current progress: The book has a total of 350 pages. The English translation has been completed, and 280 pages have been proofread in Burmese. The translation is expected to be completed by December this year. Proofreading will be completed and made public before December next year.

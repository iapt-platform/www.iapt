- Headed by Ven. Dhammapala
- Reason for translation: Dhammapada holds an important position in Theravada Buddhism. However, there is no complete Chinese translation of the commentary. To fill this gap, the project to translate the complete stories and verses of Dhammapada with commentary for Chinese readers has been initiated.
- Reference:Dhammapadapāḷi, Dhammapada-aṭṭhakathā,  (Dhammapada-aṭṭhakathā nissaya,four book), Pya That Kyaun Sayadaw Ashin Sāradassī， (Dhammapada-aṭṭhakathā nissayafour book),Sujanābhivaṃsa
- Methodology: Directly translate word by word from the original text compiled in Myanmar's sixth edition. During the translation process, difficult words and grammatical phenomena are also referred to the Pali-Burmese commentary nissaya to determine the order of expression for words and grammar, striving for rigor, accuracy, and precision. All translated verses have been rechecked and proofread.
- Participants: Ven. Sunanda, Ven. Dhammananda, Ven. Dhammapala
- Current progress: Initial translation of chapters 1-18, 20-22 and proofreading of chapter 2 have been completed. The entire translation will be completed within three months and proofreading will be completed next year.
